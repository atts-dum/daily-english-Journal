## Beware of upsets

### Original
I felt angry today, but don’t know why.  
I suppose high blood pressure, lack of sleeping time or simply aging.  
Scary moments while driving a few times and the biggest failure was dropped my favorite water bottle and it broke.  
Calm down…  

### Corrected
I felt angry today, but I'm not sure why.  
I'd say it's probably high blood pressure, not getting enough sleep, or just getting older.  
I had a few scary moments while driving, and the worst thing that happened was that my favorite water bottle fell out and broke.  
Chill out...
