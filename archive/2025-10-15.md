## When did I become so stubborn?

### Original
I admit I’m a stubborn. More than say,  I have a short temple.
Actually I got angry two times today and more than a little people feel bad.
Someone say elder should be honest, if you don’t like doing it, you can reject.
but When I was young I wasn’t a short temple and stubborn. When I did become….?

### Corrected
I admit that I am stubborn. I have a short temper, to be honest.
I got angry twice today, and more than a few people felt bad.
Someone said that elders should be honest and reject things they don't like doing.
But when I was young, I wasn’t stubborn or short-tempered. When did I become this way?
