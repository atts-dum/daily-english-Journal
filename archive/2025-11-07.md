## Haircutting

### Original
Almost three months have been passed when I went to the haircutting Salon last.  
My hair cover a half of ears, that exceeds my set standards, I hate　the feeling of my hair touching my ears.  
I want to go to haircutting, but there are financial problems, I’m short on cash.  

### Corrected
It's been almost three months since I last went to the hair salon.  
My hair covers half of my ears, which is more than I'd like. I can't stand the feeling of my hair touching my ears.  
I'm looking to get a haircut, but I'm a bit short on cash because of some financial issues.
