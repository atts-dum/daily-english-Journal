## Preparing for tax filing

### Original
It’s about time to start preparing for tax filing. Past two years, I started it when applications have been accepted.  
The year before last it took three weeks; last year it took one week. It’s completely ridiculous.  
This year, I’m starting early to avoid work piling up!
