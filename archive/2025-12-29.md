## Busy Day?

### Original
I got up at 5:40 and ate bred and jam, started cleaning the room.  
I went out midway to make a bank transfer and took pictures of Mt.Fuji with the tripod I bought yesterday.  
I resumed cleaning and finished it by midday.  
In the afternoon, I entered data for my tax return, but it was inefficient.  

### Corrected
I got up at 5:40 and had some breakfast, then started cleaning the room.  
I went out midway to make a bank transfer and took pictures of Mt. Fuji with the tripod I bought yesterday.  
I got back to cleaning and finished up by midday.  
This afternoon, I was working on my tax return, but my efficiency was poor.
