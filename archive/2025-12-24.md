## Am I irritated?

### Original
Recently many times happen that I am irritated at trivial matters.  
For example at lazy students walking around, regarding Y’s morning word, impatience?  
It actually makes my stomach churn like when I was a salaryman. I’ll have to go to the doctor.  

### Corrected
Lately, I've been getting pretty annoyed by the little things.  
For instance, seeing students walking leisurely, or Y's morning words—is it irritation?  
It actually makes me feel sick to my stomach, like when I was a salaryman. I'll have to go to the doctor.
