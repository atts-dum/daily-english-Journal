## Easy days at work

### Original
Tuesday and Thursday are easy at work, compared to other 3 days.  
Because the former has fewer deliveries than the latter. So I went back home 1 hour earlier than yesterday.  
But tomorrow will be busy, I feel a little blue.　Let's go!  

### Corrected
Tuesday and Thursday are pretty chill at work, but the other three days are a whole different story.  
The former has fewer deliveries than the latter. I headed back home an hour earlier than I did yesterday.  
But tomorrow is going to be busy, and I'm feeling a bit down.　Let's do this!
