## Walking with the Camera

### Original
I went for a walk in the neighborhood park, of course with new camera!  
However Y doesn’t know  it exist. So put it into my backpack and took it out from the home.  
I took pictures of Mt.Ooyama, birds, airplane and distant view of Hiratuka.  
Theme-less, crappy pictures indeed.  

### Corrected
I went for a stroll in the local park, and, naturally, I brought my new camera along.  
But Y doesn't know about it. I put it in my backpack and took it out of the house.  
I snapped some pics of Mt. Ooyama, some birds, an airplane, and the distant view of Hiratuka.  
The pictures are pretty bad, since they don't have a theme.
