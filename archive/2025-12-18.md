## Work efficiency

### Original
I input some working data into Excel and analyze work efficiency every work-days.  
Working time, mileage, number of delivers show mileage per trip and number of delivers per hour.  
These are useful for checking the quality of my work efficiency, by the way, today was no good.  

### Corrected
I enter some work-related data into Excel to track my daily work efficiency.  
Work hours, distance traveled, and number of deliveries show the distance per delivery and deliveries per hour.  
It's very helpful for checking work quality and efficiency. But today wasn't so great.
