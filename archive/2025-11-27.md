## WW2, Battle of Peleliu, Paradise’s Guernica

### Original
Today was ended Battle of Peleliu in WW2, 1944. Near 13,000 Japan and US solder killed.  
Soon a Manga Film relies that title is “Peleliu, Paradise’s Guernica”.  
I feel a little discomfort for a part of title “Guernica”, known for the tragedies of war.  
Many casualties are common both, but Peleliy was solder’s, another was civilian’s.  
Is it appropriate? Why did they use?    

### Corrected
Today was the end of the Battle of Peleliu in World War II in 1944. Around 13,000 Japanese and American soldiers lost their lives.  
The Manga Film that's coming out soon is called "Peleliu, Paradise's Guernica."  
Using “Guernica,” known for the tragedy of war, in the title feels a bit off.  
There were a lot of casualties on both sides, but Peleliu was a soldier and another was a civilian.  
Is it appropriate? Why did they use it?
