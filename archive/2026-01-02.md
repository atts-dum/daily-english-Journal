## First shrine visit

### Original
N came home yesterday, She made us happy and had an enjoyable chat.  
Today, N and I visited Izumo Taish Shrine, it was first of new year. I’d first experience to go to there in this season after moving to Hadano.  
Since the start of the year, I’ve been involved with my hometown. I want to cherish my hometown.

N came home yesterday, and she made us happy. We had a nice chat with her.  
Today, N and I went to Izumo Grand Shrine for our first shrine visit of the year. It was our first visit this season since moving to Hadano.  
Since the start of the new year, I've kept ties with my hometown. I want to cherish.
