## Time flies

### Original
Today is first day of my year-end and new year holidays.  
I went to get my tires changed in the morning. A shop master said that my winter tires would expired in this season.  
I’ll should buy new that costs between 70,000 to 100,000 yen. How awful!  
Tomorrow We go to our daughter’s house to help her and I meet my old friends in Shinjuku.  
Time pass quickly, so make the most of my time.  

### Corrected
Today is the first day of my year-end and new year holidays.  
I went to get my tires changed in the morning. The shop owner said, “Your current winter tires will last through this season, but they're nearing the end of their life.”  
I'll probably have to buy new tires for between 70,000 and 100,000 yen. What a hassle!  
Tomorrow, we're heading over to our daughter's place to lend a hand, and then I'm meeting some old friends in Shinjuku.  
Time flies by. So I should make the most of our time.
