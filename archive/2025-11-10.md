## Expenses Review

### Original
I checked the expenses of J:com, which is the cable TV company.  
I fond the useless service charge, I can cut 600 Yen expense. It’s user support service, I didn’t use, recently.  
I wonder that cancelling of mobile line for iPad mini, It would save 1,078 Yen.  
I’ll make a decision about it tomorrow.  

### Corrected
I took a look at J:com's expenses, since they're the cable TV company.  
I found a way to cut 600 yen in expenses by avoiding the useless service charge. I haven't used the user support service recently.  
I'm curious about the cancellation of the mobile line for the iPad mini. It'd save 1,078 yen.  
I'll decide about it tomorrow.
