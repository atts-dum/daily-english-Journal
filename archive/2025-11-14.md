## Speed of Time

### Original
I delivered 20 supper boxes today, one old man user said another week has passed.  
He is always friendly and shows consideration, maybe same generation.  
I agree that the Time passed quickly, Monday to Friday are going instantly.  
I suppose it feeling is a type of aging.  

### Corrected
I delivered 20 supper boxes today, and one older gentleman mentioned that another week has gone by.  
He's always friendly and considerate, and I'd guess he's around my age.  
I think he's right. Time seems to fly by. Monday to Friday just goes by in a flash.  
I suppose it's a kind of aging process.
