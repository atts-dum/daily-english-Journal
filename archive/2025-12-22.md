## Negative Example

### Original
Old man said see how others act and correct your own behavior.  
Today I was bombarded with furious honking at the intersection.　It’s the same thing I might do to someone who’s being slow.  
My actions up until now showed a lack of imagination regarding how others might feel.  

### Corrected
The old guy said, "Just watch how other people act and try to work on your own behavior."  
Today, I was met with a ton of angry honking at the intersection.　It's the same approach I'd take with someone who's being slow.  
My actions up until now showed a lack of imagination regarding how others might feel.
