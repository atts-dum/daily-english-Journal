## Photographing birds

### Original
I went to the Ohne park to take  pictures of wild birds with my new camera.  
I wasn’t good at using it, so I missed the photo opportunity.  
There were popular and relatively little motion birds, for example crows, magpies.  
But I spend a late autumn afternoon in the gentle sunshine, so I felt relaxed.  

### Corrected
I went to the Ohne Park to take pictures of wild birds with my new camera.  
I wasn't good at using it, so I missed the photo op. For example, I could only take photos of common birds like crows and ducks, which don't move much.  
But I spent an afternoon in late fall in the sun, so I was feeling pretty relaxed.
