## Litening to Yuming

### Original
I listened to Matutoya Yumi’s newest album, during on my walk to a bookshop.  
It had released recently, which was using  AI that made the 71 years old singers voice sound younger.  
All right, She is young. Some songs were a bit boring, but another were nostalgic.  

### Corrected
I listened to Matutoya Yumi's newest album on my walk to the bookshop.  
Recently released, it seems they used AI to make the voice of a 71-year-old singer sound younger.  
Okay, she's young. Some songs were a bit boring, but others were nostalgic.
