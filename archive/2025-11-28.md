## Go to the barber

### Original
I went to the barber after three months, very relaxed.  
I think getting a haircut is more relaxing than a hot spring.  
I sometimes watch the TV program that asking pensioner on payday which “ What do you want to pay for your favorite thing?”.  
I’ll answer “Go to the barber” immediately.  

### Corrected
I finally got my hair cut at the barber shop for the first time in three months. It was really relaxing.  
I'd say getting a haircut at the barber shop is more relaxing than going to a hot spring.  
I sometimes see TV programs where they ask pensioner on payday, "What do you most want to spend your money on?"  
I'd immediately say, "Going to the barber shop."
