## Reviewed smartphone plans

### Original
I canceled the pocket wifi, Rakuten mobile, costing  2.181 yen this month.  
And I reviewed current UQ mobile smartphone plan,that costs 800 yen more.  
I only saved about 1,300 yen, but I got the benefit of unifying my equipment and increasing my data allowance to 30GB.  
 
### Corrected
I canceled the pocket wifi Rakuten mobile, which cost 2,181 yen this month.  
I also took a look at the current UQ mobile smartphone plan, which is priced at 800 yen more.  
I only saved about 1,300 yen, but I got the benefit of unifying my equipment and increasing my data allowance to 30GB.
