## Payday

### Original
Today was the pension payment date every two months.  
Not only me but Y looking forward payday, today.  
She went to the bank first thing in the morning then went shopping for Atsugi.  

### Corrected
Today was the bimonthly pension payment day.  
Not just me, but Y was also looking forward to the payment day.  
She went to the bank first thing in the morning, then headed out shopping in Atsugi.  
Y's smile is nice.
