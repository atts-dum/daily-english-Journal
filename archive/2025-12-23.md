## Car Stickers

### Original
When I drove I saw sometimes the stickers that express boarding kid (or kids) in this car.  
Many are labeled “Child in car”, “Kid in car”, I wonder if it’s probably better to use the plural form and need an article.  
But I saw “Kids in the car” sticker this morning. But if it are me, I’ll chose “Kids on board”.  
AI also recommends it.  

### Corrected
When I was driving, I sometimes saw stickers that said "boarding child(ren)" on the car.  
Many are labeled “Child in car” or “Kid in car.” I wonder if the plural form is used and an article is needed.  
I saw a "Kids in the car" sticker this morning, though. If I had to choose, I'd go with "Kids on board."
