## Begin filing my taxes

### Original
I set the accounting software today, which costs about 23,000 yen which a year subscription.  
It’s too expensive for me, because the refund are almost same price.  
But I luck the accounting knowledge, so it’s very useful and support me.  
I must think it’s consulting fee. Much for self study and loose time.  

### Corrected
Today, I set up accounting software. It's about ¥23,000 for an annual subscription.  
That's almost the same amount as my tax refund, so it's too expensive for me.  
Since my accounting knowledge is limited, it's extremely useful and helpful.  
I'll consider it a consulting fee. It's equivalent to self-study or spending a lot of time on it.
