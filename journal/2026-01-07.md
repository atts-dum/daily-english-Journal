## Get Certified!

**Original**
I’ve been using Youtube and AI since yesterday, I made decision to get certified.  
Specifically,  the Real Estate Transaction Specialist license.  
I feel easy decision, but it’s my character! It’s a different qualification, but never mind about I I did failure.  

### Corrected
I've been using YouTube and AI since yesterday and decided to get certified.  
I'm talking about the Real Estate Transaction Agent license.  
I know it's a simple decision, but that's just how I am. I don’t let past failures with other certifications get me down.  

### Memo (dum!)
資格取得を目指すぞ！YouTubeやAIを使いながら宅建資格を取ることに。安直なところが性分で、実のところ何度も失敗を繰り返している。  
🤖 I'm going for that license! I'm aiming to get my real estate license using YouTube and AI. I'm naturally a bit lazy, and honestly, I've failed this exam multiple times.  

### Picked Phrase
- カタカナ語に毒されて「character」が正しく綴れなかった。 🤖 I was poisoned by katakana words and couldn't spell “character” correctly.
- 「that's just how I am. I don't let past failures with other certifications get me down.」こんな表現ボクには無理。「これがボクの性格　以前の失敗なんざ気にもしない」と伝わればいいだけ。　🤖 I can't pull off expressions like that. I just want it to come across as, “This is my personality—I don't even care about past failures.”
