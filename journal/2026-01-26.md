## Time to start?

### Original 🤔
Tax filing season will begin in three weeks.  
I’m convinced that I finished about 60% of the work, so if I can concentrate, I can do quickly.  
Someone said submitting too early makes you fool. I'll submit it slowly.  

### Corrected 🤖
Tax filing season starts in three weeks.  
I'm confident about 60% of the work is done, so if I can focus, I should be able to finish quickly.  
Someone said, “If you file too early, you'll look like a fool.” I'll file slowly.  

### Memo (dum!)
ちょっとAIを使って作文したとはいえ、OriginalとCorrectedの差があまりない気がする  
ボクが腕を上げたか、DeepLが忖度したか  

### Picked Phrase
- you'll look like a fool. バカを見る
