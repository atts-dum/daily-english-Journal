## New Owner

### Original 🤔
It seems like the house across the street sold.  
That owner moved another city due to his wife’s death.  
This morning scaffolding work for painting began.  
I wonder what color new owner choosed.  

### Corrected 🤖
It seems like the house across the street was sold.  
The owner moved to another city after his wife passed away.  
Scaffolding for painting was set up this morning.  
I wonder what color the new owner chose.  

### Memo (dum!)
オレンジ色の外壁に当初は戸惑ったけど、その内慣れた　亡くなられた奥さんに合掌  
🤖 Initially, I was taken aback by the orange exterior walls, but I grew accustomed to them over time. I bow my head in prayer for his late wife.  

### Picked Phrase
- the house across the street sold → was sold OK! but “the new owner choosed → chose” Why?  🤖 I get this, but why this one?
