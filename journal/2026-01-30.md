## Britain

### Original 🤔
I think some English words can express in kanji.  
For example, writing pronunciation “Britain” in kanji is 振天.  
It means shake the heavens, current UK is that?, I don’t believe.  
But It’s just perfect name for a sumo wrestler, now a young brit challenge to be sumo wrestler.  

### Corrected 🤖
Some English words can be expressed using kanji.  
For example, the pronunciation of “Britain” is written in kanji as ‘振天’.  
This means “to shake the heavens,” but whether modern Britain actually does that is doubtful.  
It's perfect for a sumo wrestler's name. Young Britons are challenging themselves to become sumo wrestlers.  

### Memo (dum!)
3人目の英国出身力士の誕生かと、新聞で知った　しこ名に採用してくれ、ボクがゴッドファーザーになる  
🤖 I read in the paper that a third British-born sumo wrestler might be born. Adopt me as his godfather and let me choose his sumo wrestler's name.

### Picked Phrase
- to become sumo wrestlers  力士は複数形  🤖 Sumo wrestlers are plural
