## X Post

### Original
At last I was made the GitHub repository, daily-english-journal by AI support.  
But no-one access it. AI said it’s natural, because it looks like building a sign in desert.  
And you should appeal the presence, X is useful. I post, but a little difficult.  

### Corrected
The daily-english-journal GitHub repository is finally complete, with AI assistance.  
But no one is accessing it. According to the AI, this is to be expected—it's like putting up a sign in the desert.  
And it says I should promote its purpose. X is useful, so I posted, but there are some tricky points.  

### Memo (dum!)
砂漠に立てた看板とはよく言った。座布団一枚

### Picked Phrase
- The daily-english-journal GitHub repositoryって、ボクの趣旨はGitHubでdaily-english-journalというリポジトリが完成したなんだが、いいのかなぁ
