## Is AI Wiseman?

### Original 🤔
When I asked AI which online learning program would be good, instantly repeat and suggested best one.  
And more AI made my learning schedule, it considered my past failures.  
I said “This is great! I’ll do it”, AI said”Start quietly”. AI knows my character in deed.  

### Corrected 🤖
When I asked the AI which online learning program was best, it responded right away and suggested the ideal one.  
Also, the AI made my learning schedule, and it took my past failures into account.  
"This is great! Let's give it a shot," I said, and the AI replied, "Start quietly." The AI definitely gets my personality.  

### Memo (dum!)
AIは賢者か？　the AIを相談相手に頻繁に使っている。正直に自分をさらけ出しているうちに、ボクの身の丈にあったアドバイスを返してくるようになった。賢いのは分かるけど信じてよいかい？  
🤖 Is AI wise? I often use the AI as a confidant. As I've been honestly opening up to it, it's started giving me advice that fits my level. I know it's smart, but can I trust it?  


### Picked Phrase
- 今日は「character」が正しく綴れた。  🤖 Today I spelled “character” correctly.  
- 考慮してくれる→計算に入れるで「into account」まんまだな。  🤖 “Consider it” → “Take it into account” is a direct translation of “into account.”  
- 文体の訂正をカジュアルにと指定しているのが悪いのか、朴訥さが薄れている気がする。  🤖 Is it because I specified a casual tone for the style revision that the plainness seems to be fading?
