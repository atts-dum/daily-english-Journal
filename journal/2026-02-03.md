## Teacher, Monk, Cop

### Original 🤔
Teacher, Monk, Cop that I’ve disliked since childhood.  
No particular reason, but I didn’t want to close too much.  
Today, A cop watched I stoped at stop line behind objects, of course stopped correctly!  
I hate his eyes that follow me until I passed away. I do’t think we’ll be friends.  

### Corrected 🤖
Teachers, monks, and cops—I've disliked them since I was a child.  
There's no particular reason, but I never wanted to get close to them.  
Today, a cop watched me stop at the stop line from behind a object. Of course I stopped correctly!  
I hate those eyes that seem to follow me until I pass by. I don't think we could ever be friends.  

### Memo (dum!)
実際のところ止まったか自信がない　無意識に止まったとしたらたいしたもんだ  
🤖 I'm not sure if I actually stopped. If I stopped unconsciously, that's pretty impressive.  

### Picked Phrase
- until I passed away → until I pass by 過去形はまちがい　それにpass away = to die 🤖 The past tense is incorrect. Also, “pass away” = to die.
