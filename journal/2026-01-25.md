## The depths of cold

### Original 🤔
Today was sunny again, but a little cold.  
Since ancient times, it was most coldest time of the year.  
But limited, heavy snow is falling in the Sea of Japan side.  

### Corrected 🤖
It was sunny again today, but a bit cold.  
This time of year is often considered the coldest period of the year.  
But it's nothing compared to the heavy snowfall on the Sea of Japan side.  

### Memo (dum!)
この季節は寒さの底といわれる。一昨日見た宅配の青年は半袖だったが、日本海側の同僚はさすがに無理だろう

### Picked Phrase
- this time of yearとperiod of the year 冠詞のありなし
- it’s nothing compared to たかが知れている
